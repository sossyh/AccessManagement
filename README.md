## Features

- JWT Authentication: Implements secure authentication using JSON Web Tokens.
- Authorization: Provides role-based access control (RBAC) for managing user permissions.
- Clean Architecture: Utilizes a clean and modular architecture for better code organization and maintainability.
- Secure APIs: Ensures secure communication between clients and servers.
- Logging and Error Handling: Implements logging and error handling mechanisms for better debugging and monitoring.
